# DPIA: GETMONI Digital Lending Platform

*This project draws on real work, with all company details anonymised.*

---

Our client, GETCO SOLUTIONS LIMITED, operates a digital lending and Buy-Now-Pay-Later platform (GETMONI) in Nigeria. They process highly sensitive personal data for credit assessment. Our objective was to conduct an NDP Act-compliant [DPIA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RlebL4Bcau7AColH-7owsdmEasmpkTLT?usp=sharing) to identify and mitigate privacy risks, protecting both users and the business from regulatory harm.

## The Approach

We used a structured, collaborative method.

*   We applied the official NDP Act GAID Schedule 4 DPIA [Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SldtEtiucIhGwASWEHbw95dlqmk6fkYd/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true), adapted to GETMONI's workflow, which the client populated.

*   We verified lawful bases and mapped data flows, then focused on high-risk areas like cross-border transfers and third-party vendors.

*   We synthesised all findings, evidence, and recommendations into a final [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/128d4XAZgszXGtOI3Pijr0JFf53Aft8DL/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) for leadership, complete with risk ratings and a remediation plan.

## Practical Insights & Recommendations

*   **Undocumented Cross-Border Transfers:** Data flows to the US, EU, and South Africa were high risk. *Recommendation*: Conduct immediate Cross-border-focused DPIA and document lawful bases.

*   **No Record of Processing Activities (ROPA):** Lack of a central ROPA created an accountability gap. *Recommendation*: Prioritise creating a simple, living ROPA as the foundational governance document.

*   **Weak Consent Management:** Consent lacked audit trails, undermining lawful basis claims. *Recommendation*: Implement system-logged consent records.

## Reflection & Learning

This project confirmed that strong technical controls are not enough without solid governance. The highest risks came from procedural gaps, not system failures.
